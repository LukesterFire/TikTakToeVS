# TikTakToeVS
This is a Tiktaktoe game that I using to practice coding in C++. I plan to continuously expand on this code as I learn new things. 
I'm mostly using this as a project I can use to practice coding

Ideas of things I can add:
* Save command (that acually creates a save file)
* GUI
* Extremely lightweight branch to run on the most potato hardware (ex: a pregnancy test LOL, or small enough to fit in a QR code)
* Mobile versions (I'll probably start with android)
* User database
* Menu
* Login screen
* Login encryption

more ideas likely to come
comment your ideas if you have any
